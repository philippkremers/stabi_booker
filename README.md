# stabi_booker
This script automatically books selected seats at Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin as soon as they become available.

# Installation
First, unpack the entire directory on your server and adjust the configuration variables at the beginning of stabi_booker.php to ensure that the script signs in the right person. Second, set up a cronjob that executes stabi_booker.php on a regular basis (say, in five minute intervals).
